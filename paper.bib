	abstract = "Predicting returns in the stock market is usually posed as a forecasting problem where prices are predicted. Intrinsic volatility in the stock market across the globe makes the task of prediction challenging. Consequently, forecasting and diffusion modeling undermines a diverse range of problems encountered in predicting trends in the stock market. Minimizing forecasting error would minimize investment risk. In the current work, we pose the problem as a direction-predicting exercise signifying gains and losses. We develop an experimental framework for the classification problem which predicts whether stock prices will increase or decrease with respect to the price prevailing n days earlier. Two algorithms, random forests, and gradient boosted decisioâ€˜n trees (using XGBoost) facilitate this connection by using ensembles of decision trees. We test our approach and report the accuracies for a variety of companies as improvement over existing predictions. A novelty of the current work is about the selection of technical indicators and their use as features, with high accuracy for medium to long-run prediction of stock price direction."
